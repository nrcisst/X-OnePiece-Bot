    "I mean Current Loki? No doubt, dude pose a great power. But a dfless Loki without Ragnir, I can't imagine him beating Harald who was Xebec equal.\n\nGaban and Shanks visited the castle, maybe they helped Loki out?\nCan't wait to see the reveal of that Event. https://t.co/Dc0ByjHuKc",
    "#ONEPIECE1165\nWith all due respect to Loki, he never defeated Harald alone. \nWe're talking about Loki who didn't even have Ragnir and his fruit. \nJust look how strong DR Xebec was. Either Harald stopped himself, or Gaban, Loki, and Shanks somehow stopped Harald together. https://t.co/8tj5IWUOP0",

    "#ONEPIECE1165 \nI think Xebec CoC works similar to Reiatsu, stronger reiatsu nullifies weaker attacks, Xebec CoC nullifies weaker attacks. You can\u00b4t hurt him unless your CoC is equal or stronger. \n\nMaybe a reason why Garling and the Admiral at Reverie had hard time to hurt him. https://t.co/MY8X9r2KS4",

    "#ONEPIECE1165 \nGarp and Roger can't harm Xebec even with advanced Conqueror's Haki; he possesses a barrier of Conqueror's Haki that neutralizes attacks, so they can't even hurt him. \n\nTo hurt Xebec, you need a stronger Conqueror's Haki.\n(A reason why they combinated their haki). https://t.co/RFKE0L5QXe",
